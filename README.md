# shader_compilation_error

This is a minimal reproduction of a "Shader compilation error" that is occuring for me in VS Code when working with Flutter.

It happens at a lot of places for me. I'm taking the `image_picker`-dependency for demonstration here just because it's the most reliable way of reproducing this for me.
